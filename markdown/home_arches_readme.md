Arches is a central design system for the American College of Cardiology. This system, through some compiler wizardry, builds out to variations using frameworks and product brands to be used across many products built by the ACC.  Arches vanilla is just a Utility Classes and when added to a project with an already established style sheet is made to add new styling features non-destructively. There are also variations of Arches that build on top of the two popular frameworks that currently in use at the College, Twitter Bootstrap, and Zurb Foundation.

## Utility Classes

Utility classes are a distinct departure from many previous learned CSS theories, but what utility classes allow for is an excellent separation of concerns between the HTML and CSS. The singular focus for utility classes is a single class controls a single style in CSS. Utility Class has significant benefits of reducing scope expansion in the CSS and also gives greater flexibility of crafting user interface components that are currently undefined. Html should continually be written using the best standards for semantics, but it is no longer a concern to follow a components design pattern because it is applicable at the HTML level.

#### Naming Convention

Arches does have a learning curve, but to reduce the curve the names follow a strict pattern. <a class="link" href="./section-uc.html"> learn more</a>
