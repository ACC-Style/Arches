Basic HTML

The Arches Design System, at its core, is a Utility Class Styling Design.  It is built not to prescribe the design of the HTML and components but to paint with classes to create complicated UI without having to create more styles.  Arches rely on the browser or branding defaults for basic HTML styling.  Below is a kitchen sink of HTML elements so you can see how this variation look without further alteration from adding classes. There is No basic styling around the pure DOM with the utility class only, and there is improved styling as you add Bootstrap or Foundation.

<article><p>This paragraph is nested inside an article. It contains many different, sometimes useful, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML5 tags</a>. Of course there are classics like <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and <small>small</small> but there are many others as well. Hover the following text for abbreviation tag: <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>. Similarly, you can use acronym tag like this: <acronym title="For The Win">ftw</acronym>. You can define <del>deleted text</del> which often gets replaced with <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p><p>You can also use <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which sometimes is styled similarly to the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> or <samp>samp</samp> tags. Even more specifically, there is a tag just for <var>variables</var>. Not to be mistaken with blockquotes below, the quote tag lets you denote something as <q>quoted text</q>. Lastly don't forget the sub (H<sub>2</sub>O) and sup (E = MC<sup>2</sup>) tags.</p></article>
