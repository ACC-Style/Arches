	.texture_medium            					- medium texture are used for area that are hidden away.  Collapsable navs, areas, or sidebars ususaly use the medium texture.
	.texture_dust            					- Dust is the most transparent texture allowing for the color of the background to show through the most.  This is used for the painted tops of cards, or score bars.
	.texture_dark              					- This texture predominatly used on the footer. Its rich black will alway requrie reversed text and buttons to be readable.
